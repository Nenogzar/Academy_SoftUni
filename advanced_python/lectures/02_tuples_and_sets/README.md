<details><summary> 🏛️ Tuples 🐍</summary>

<details><summary>🏛️ Ordered: They contain elements that are sequentially arranged according to their specific insertion order.</summary>

</details>
<details><summary>🏛️ Lightweight: They consume relatively small amounts of memory compared to other sequences like lists.</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>🏛️ Indexable through a zero-based index: They allow you to access their elements by integer indices that start from zero.</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>🏛️ Immutable: They don’t support in-place mutations or changes to their contained elements. They don’t support growing or shrinking operations.</summary>

<details><summary>⛓️ 1</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>⛓️ 2</summary>

<details><summary>⛓️ 3</summary>


</details>

</details>
<details><summary>🏛️ Heterogeneous: They can store objects of different data types and domains, including mutable objects.</summary>

</details>
<details><summary>🏛️ Iterable: They support iteration, so you can traverse them using a loop or comprehension while you perform operations with each of their elements.</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>🏛️ Sliceable: They support slicing operations, meaning that you can extract a series of elements from a tuple.</summary>

</details>
<details><summary>🏛️ Combinable: They support concatenation operations, so you can combine two or more tuples using the concatenation operators, which creates a new tuple.</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>🏛️ Hashable: They can work as keys in dictionaries when all the tuple items are immutable.</summary>
