1.	Jenny's Secret Message
Jenny studies programming with Python and wants to create a program that greets the user when he/she gives his/her name.
The greeting should be in the format "Hello, {name}!".
However, Jenny is in love with Johnny and would like to greet him differently: "Hello, my love!". Could you help her?

2.	Drink Something
Kids drink toddy, teens drink coke, young adults drink beer, and adults drink whisky. 
Create a program that receives a person's age and prints what he/she drinks.
Rules:
A kid is defined as someone under or at the age of 14.
A teen is defined as someone under or at the age of 18.
A young adult is defined as someone under or at the age of 21.
An adult is defined as someone above the age of 21.

3.	Chat Codes
Peter is a programming enthusiast who wants to create a chat where people will send messages via number codes. 
He starts by creating a program for only four messages. 
Create a program that receives the n number of messages sent. On the following n lines, it will receive integer numbers. 
For each number, the program should print a different message:
•	If the number is 88 - "Hello"
•	If the number is 86 - "How are you?"
•	If the number is not 88 nor 86, and it is below 88 - "GREAT!"
•	If the number is over 88 - "Bye."

4.	Maximum Multiple
On the first line, you will be given a positive number, which will serve as a divisor. 
On the second line, you will receive a positive number that will be the boundary. 
You should find the largest integer N, that is:
•	divisible by the given divisor
•	less than or equal to the given bound
•	greater than 0

5.	Orders
You work at a coffee shop, and your job is to place orders with the distributors. 
Thus, you want to know the price of each order. 

On the first line, you will receive integer N - the number of orders the shop will receive. 
For each order, you will receive the following information:
•	Price per capsule - a floating-point number in the range [0.01…100.00]
•	Days - integer in the range [1…31]
•	Capsules, needed per day - integer in the range [1…2000]
For each order, you should print a single line in the following format:
•	"The price for the coffee is: ${price}"
If you do not receive a correct order (one or more of the values are not in the given range), 
you should ignore it and move to the next one.
After you go through all orders, you need to print the total price in the following format:
•	 "Total: ${total_price}"
Both the price of a coffee and the total price must be formatted to the second decimal place.

6.	String Pureness
You will be given the number n. After that, you'll receive different strings n times. 
Your task is to check if the given strings are pure,

•	If a string is pure, print "{string} is pure."
•	Otherwise, print "{string} is not pure!"

7.	Double Char

8.	How Much Coffee Do You Need?
Everybody knows that you spend too much time awake during nighttime.
Your task is to define how much coffee you need to stay awake. 
Until you receive the command "END", you need to read commands on different lines. 
According to the commands, calculate the number of coffees you need to drink to stay awake during the daytime.
The list of events can contain the following:
•	You have homework to do ("coding").
•	You have a dog or a cat that decided to wake you up too early ("dog" or "cat").
•	You watch a movie ("movie").
•	If other events are present, they will be represented by arbitrary strings. Just ignore them!
Each event can be lowercase or uppercase:
•	If it is lowercase, you need 1 coffee by an event.
•	If it is uppercase, you need 2 coffees by an event.
In the end, print the number of coffees you will need. If the count has exceeded 5, just print "You need extra sleep".
