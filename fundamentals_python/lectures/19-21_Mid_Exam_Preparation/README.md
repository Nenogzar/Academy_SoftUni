NB! Link for judge system works only if you are registered in Software University Sofia !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Write a program that prints you a receipt for your new computer.
You will receive the parts' prices (without tax) until you receive what type of customer this is - special or regular.
Once you receive the type of customer you should print the receipt.
The taxes are 20% of each part's price you receive. 
If the customer is special, he has a 10% discount on the total price with taxes.
If a given price is not a positive number, you should print "Invalid price!" on the console and continue with the next price.
If the total price is equal tzero, you should print "Invalid order!" on the console.

Input

You will receive numbers representing prices (without tax) until command "special" or "regular":

Output

* The receipt should be in the following format: 

"Congratulations you've just bought a new computer!

Price without taxes: {total price without taxes}$

Taxes: {total amount of taxes}$

-----------

Total price: {total price with taxes}$"


Note: All prices should be displayed tthe second digit after the decimal point!
The discount is applied only on the total price. Discount is only applicable tthe final price!

Write a program that finds a place for the tourist on a lift. 
Every wagon should have a maximum of 4 people on it. If a wagon is full, you should direct the people tthe next one with space available.

Input

On the first line, you will receive how many people are waiting tget on the lift

On the second line, you will receive the current state of the lift separated by a single space: " ".

Output

When there is nmore available space left on the lift, or there are nmore people in the queue, 
you should print on the console the final state of the lift's wagons separated by " " and one of the following messages:

If there are nmore people and the lift have empty spots, you should print:

"The lift has empty spots!</br>{wagons separated by ' '}"

If there are still people in the queue and nmore available space, you should print:

"There isn't enough space! {people} people in a queue! </br>{wagons separated by ' '}"

If the lift is full and there are nmore people in the queue, you should print only the wagons separated by " "

Write a program that recreates the Memory game.</br>
On the first line, you will receive a sequence of elements.</br>
Each element in the sequence will have a twin. Until the player receives "end" from the console,
you will receive strings with twintegers separated by a space, representing the indexes of elements in the sequence.</br>
If the player tries tcheat and enters twequal indexes or indexes which are out of bounds of the sequence
, you should add twmatching elements at the middle of the sequence in the following format:</br>
"-{number of moves until now}a" </br>
Then print this message on the console:</br>
"Invalid input! Adding additional elements tthe board"</br>

Input

On the first line, you will receive a sequence of elements</br>
On the following lines, you will receive integers until the command "end"</br>

Output

Every time the player hit twmatching elements, you should remove them from the sequence and print on the console the following message:
"Congrats! You have found matching elements - ${element}!"</br>
If the player hit twdifferent elements, you should print on the console the following message:
"Try again!"</br>
If the player hit all matching elements before he receives "end" from the console, you should print on the console the following message: 
"You have won in {number of moves until now} turns!"</br>
If the player receives "end" before he hits all matching elements, you should print on the console the following message:
"Sorry you lose :(</br>
{the current sequence's state}"</br>

Constraints

All elements in the sequence will always have a matching element.

Write a program that keeps track of every won battle against an enemy.</br>
You will receive initial energy. Afterward, you will start receiving
the distance you need treach an enemy until the "End of battle" command is given, or you run out of energy.</br>
The energy you need for reaching an enemy is equal tthe distance you receive.</br>
Each time you reach an enemy, you win a battle, and your energy is reduced. </br>
Otherwise, if you don't have enough energy treach an enemy, end the program and print:</br>
"Not enough energy! Game ends with {count} won battles and {energy} energy".</br>
Every third won battle increases your energy with the value of your current count of won battles.</br>
Upon receiving the "End of battle" command, print the count of won battles in the following format:</br>
"Won battles: {count}. Energy left: {energy}" 

Input / Constraints

On the first line, you will receive initial energy ‚Äì an integer [1-10000].</br>
On the following lines, you will be receiving the distance of an enemy ‚Äì an integer [1-10000]</br>

Output

The description contains the proper output messages for each case and the format they should be printed.

Write a program that helps you keep track of your shot targets. </br>
You will receive a sequence with integers, separated by a single space, 
representing targets and their value. Afterward, you will be receiving 
indices until the "End" command is given, and you need tprint the targets and the count of shot targets.</br>
Every time you receive an index, you need tshoot the target on that index, if it is possible. </br>
Every time you shoot a target, its value becomes -1, and it is considered shot. </br>

Along with that, you alsneed to:</br>
Reduce all the other targets, which have greater values than your current target, with its value.</br> 
Increase all the other targets, which have less than or equal value tthe shot target, with its value.</br>
Keep in mind that you can't shoot a target, which is already shot. You alscan't increase or reduce a target, which is considered shot.
When you receive the "End" command, print the targets in their current state and the count of shot targets in the following format:</br>
"Shot targets: {count} -> {target1} {target2}‚Ä¶ {targetn}"

Input / Constraints

On the first line of input, you will receive a sequence of integers, separated by a single space ‚Äì the targets sequence.</br>

You are at the shooting gallery again, and you need a program that helps you keep track of moving targets.
On the first line, you will receive a sequence of targets with their integer values, split by a single space. 
Then, you will start receiving commands for manipulating the targets until the "End" command. 
The commands are the following:
* "Shoot {index} {power}"
  * Shoot the target at the index if it exists by reducing its value by the given power (integer value). 
  * Remove the target if it is shot. A target is considered shot when its value reaches 0.
* "Add {index} {value}"
*	Insert a target with the received value at the received index if it exists. 
*	If not, print: "Invalid placement!"
  *	"Strike {index} {radius}"
*	Remove the target at the given index and the ones before and after it depending on the radius.
*	If any of the indices in the range is invalid, print: "Strike missed!" and skip this command.

   Example:  "Strike 2 2"
      {radius}	{radius}	{strikeIndex}	{radius}	{radius}		

* "End"
  * Print the sequence with targets in the following format and end the program:

  "{target1}|{target2}‚Ä¶|{targetn}"

  Input / Constraints

* On the first line, you will receive the sequence of targets ‚Äì integer values [1-10000].
* On the following lines, until the "End" will be receiving the command described above ‚Äì strings.
* There will never be a case when the "Strike" command would empty the whole sequence.
  Output
* Print the appropriate message in case of any command if necessary.
* In the end, print the sequence of targets in the format described above.

Merry has a guinea pig named Puppy, that she loves very much.
Every month she goes tthe nearest pet store and buys him everything he needs ‚Äì food, hay, and cover.
On the first three lines, you will receive the quantity of food, hay, and cover, 
which Merry buys for a month (30 days). On the fourth line, you will receive the guinea pig's weight.
Every day Puppy eats 300 gr of food. Every second day Merry first feeds the pet, 
then gives it a certain amount of hay equal t5% of the rest of the food. On every third day, 
Merry puts Puppy cover with a quantity of 1/3 of its weight.
Calculate whether the quantity of food, hay, and cover, will be enough for a month.
If Merry runs out of food, hay, or cover, stop the program!

Input

* On the first line ‚Äì quantity food in kilograms - a floating-point number in the range [0.0 ‚Äì 10000.0]

Valentine's day is coming, and Cupid has minimal time tspread some love across the neighborhood. Help him with his mission!
You will receive a string with even integers, separated by a "@" - this is our neighborhood.
After that, a series of Jump commands will follow until you receive "Love!".
Every house in the neighborhood needs a certain number of hearts delivered by Cupid sit can celebrate Valentine's day.
The integers in the neighborhood indicate those needed hearts.
Cupid starts at the position of the first house (index 0) and must jump by a given length.
The jump commands will be in this format: "Jump {length}". 
Every time he jumps from one house tanother, the needed hearts for the visited house are decreased by 2: 
* If the needed hearts for a certain house become equal t0, print on the console "Place {house_index} has Valentine's day." 
* If Cupid jumps ta house where the needed hearts are already 0, print on the console "Place {house_index} already had Valentine's day."
* Keep in mind that Cupid can have a larger jump length than the size of the neighborhood, 
and if he does jump outside of it, he should start from the first house again (index 0)
For example, we are given this neighborhood: 6@6@6. Cupid is at the start and jumps with a length of 2.
He will end up at index 2 and decrease the needed hearts by 2: [6, 6, 4]. Next,
he jumps again with a length of 2 and goes outside the neighborhood, she goes back tthe first house (index 0)
and again decreases the needed hearts there: [4, 6, 4].
Input
* On the first line, you will receive a string with even integers separated by "@" ‚Äì the neighborhood and the number of hearts for each house.
* On the next lines, until "Love!" is received, you will be getting jump commands in this format: "Jump {length}".
Output
In the end, print Cupid's last position and whether his mission was successful or not:
* "Cupid's last position was {last_position_index}."
* If each house has had Valentine's day, print: 
  * "Mission was successful."
* If not, print the count of all houses that didn't celebrate Valentine's Day:
  * "Cupid has failed {houseCount} places."
  Constraints
* The neighborhood's size will be in the range [1‚Ä¶20]
* Each house will need an even number of hearts in the range [2 ‚Ä¶ 10]

Create a program that calculates bonus points for each student enrolled in a course.
On the first line, you are going treceive the number of the students. On the second line,
you will receive the total number of lectures in the course. The course has an additional bonus,
which you will receive on the third line. On the following lines,
you will be receiving the count of attendances for each student.
The bonus is calculated with the following formula:
{total bonus} = {student attendances} / {course lectures} * (5 + {additional bonus})
Find the student with the maximum bonus and print them, along with his attendances,
in the following format:
"Max Bonus: {max bonus points}."
"The student has attended {student attendances} lectures."
Round the bonus points at the end tthe nearest larger number.
Input / Constrains
* On the first line, you are going treceive the number of the students ‚Äì an integer in the range [0‚Ä¶50]
* On the second line, you will receive the number of the lectures ‚Äì an integer number in the range [0...50].
* On the third line, you will receive the additional bonus ‚Äì an integer number in the range [0‚Ä¶.100].
* On the following lines, you will be receiving the attendance of each student.

Pirates are invading the sea, and you're tasked thelp them plunder
Create a program that checks if target plunder is reached. 
First, you will receive how many days the pirating lasts.

 Then you will receive how much the pirates plunder for a day. 
 Last you will receive the expected plunder at the end.

Calculate how much plunder the pirates manage tgather. Each day they gather the plunder. 
Keep in mind that they attack more ships every third day and 
add additional plunder ttheir total gain, which is 50% of the daily plunder.
 Every fifth day the pirates encounter a warship, and after the battle, they lose 30% of their total plunder.
If the gained plunder is more or equal tthe target, print the following:
"Ahoy! {totalPlunder} plunder gained."
If the gained plunder is less than the target. Calculate the percentage left and print the following:
"Collected only {percentage}% of the plunder."
Both numbers should be formatted tthe 2nd decimal place.
Input
* On the 1st line, you will receive the days of the plunder ‚Äì an integer number in the range [0‚Ä¶100000]
* On the 2nd line, you will receive the daily plunder ‚Äì an integer number in the range [0‚Ä¶50]
* On the 3rd line, you will receive the expected plunder ‚Äì a real number in the range [0.0‚Ä¶10000.0]

On the first line, you will receive the initial loot of the treasure chest,
 which is a string of items separated by a "|".
"{loot1}|{loot2}|{loot3} ‚Ä¶ {lootn}"
The following lines represent commands until "Yohoho!" which ends the treasure hunt:

"Loot {item1} {item2}‚Ä¶{itemn}":

* Pick up treasure loot along the way. Insert the items at the beginning of the chest. 
* If an item is already contained, don't insert it.

The pirates encounter a huge Man-O-War at sea. 
Create a program that tracks the battle and either chooses a winner or prints a stalemate.
 On the first line, you will receive the status of the pirate ship, 
 which is a string representing integer sections separated by ">".
  On the second line, you will receive the same type of status, but for the warship: 

"{section1}>{section2}>{section3}‚Ä¶ {sectionn}"

On the third line, you will receive the maximum health capacity a section of the ship can reach. 
The following lines represent commands until "Retire":

* "Fire {index} {damage}" - the pirate ship attacks the warship with the given damage at that section.
 Check if the index is valid and if not, skip the command. If the section breaks (health <= 0) the warship sinks,
  print the following and stop the program: "You won! The enemy ship has sunken."
* "Defend {startIndex} {endIndex} {damage}" - the warship attacks the pirate ship 
with the given damage at that range (indexes are inclusive). Check if both indexes are valid and if not,
 skip the command. If the section breaks (health <= 0) the pirate ship sinks, print the following and stop the program:
"You lost! The pirate ship has sunken."
* "Repair {index} {health}" - the crew repairs a section of the pirate ship with the given health. 
Check if the index is valid and if not, skip the command. 
The health of the section cannot exceed the maximum health capacity.
* "Status" - prints the count of all sections of the pirate ship that need repair soon, 
which are all sections that are lower than 20% of the maximum health capacity. Print the following:

<details> <summary>üõ†Ô∏èüêç Example & Code</summary>

####

<details><summary>üõ†Ô∏èExample</summary>

Create a program that will help Anna calculate how many biscuits her factory can make in a month (**30 days**) and the percentage of production compared tanother factory's production.</br>
First, you will receive the biscuits produced **per day** (per worker). After that, you will receive the count of workers in your factory. Last, you will receive the number of biscuits that the **competing factory produces for 30 days**.</br>
You need tcalculate the production of your factory within **30 days**. Then you should calculate how much more or less biscuits you produce compared tthe other factory (**in percentage**). There will be ncase where the factories will produce the same number of biscuits.</br>
Every **third day** the workers produce **only 75%** of the usual production. Keep in mind that there can be only a whole biscuit after making calculations for each day ‚Äì format them tthe lower number.</br>
In the end, **print the number** of biscuits produced for **30 days** in the following format:</br>
**"You have produced {countBiscuits} biscuits for the past month.**"</br>
Then print the **percentage of the difference**, formatted tthe 2nd decimal place, in the following format:</br>
If your production is **bigger** than the other factory:</br>
**"You produce {percentage} percent more biscuits."**</br>
If not:</br>
**"You produce {percentage} percent less biscuits."**

#### Input

* On the first line, you will receive the number of biscuits a worker produces per day ‚Äì an integer number in the range [1‚Ä¶200].
* On the second line, you will receive the count of the workers in your factory ‚Äì an integer number in the range [1‚Ä¶1000].
* On the third line, you will receive the number of biscuits that the competing factory produces for 30 days ‚Äì an integer number in the range [1‚Ä¶264].
NOTE: The input will always be in the correct format.

Create a program that helps John keep track of the coffee he has. You will receive a list of the coffees that John has in stock, on a single line separated by a single space in the following format:</br>
**"{coffee1} {coffee2} {coffee3} ... {coffeeNn}"**.
Then you will receive a number ‚Äì n - a count of commands you need to execute over your list. There are four possible commands:

* **"Include {coffee}"**:
  * Add the coffee at the end of your list.
* **"Remove {first/last} {numberOfCoffees}"**:
  * Depending on the input, remove either the "**first**" or the "**last**" number of coffees from your list.
  * If you have fewer coffees in your list than the given number, skip this command.
* **"Prefer {coffeeIndex1} {coffeeIndex2}"**:
  * If both coffee indexes exist in your list, take the two coffees and change their places.
  * Otherwise, skip the command.
* **"Reverse"**:
  * Reverse the order of the coffees.

In the end, print the manipulated list in the following format:
"Coffees:
{coffee1} {coffee2} ‚Ä¶ {coffeeNn}"


#### Input / Constraints

* On the 1st line, you will receive the **starting** list with the names of the coffees separated by a " " (empty space).

<details><summary>üõ†Ô∏èExample</summary>

_John is very angry with his owner because he left him alone during the teamwork defenses for the Programming Fundamentals Course at SoftUni. It's time for John to get his payback, and he will do it by breaking various household items._

Each item has a **price rating**, a number that describes how valuable that item is for John's owner. You will be **given an entry point** from which John will **break** the **items to his left** and **then** to **his right**. John **will never** break the item at his **entry point**.</br>
You must calculate the damage to **both** his **left** and **right**, then print **only the higher (bigger)** damage to the household. If both **sums** are **equal**, print the **left** one.</br>
#### Input / Constrains
* On the first line, you will receive the price ratings, separated by (", "). Each element will be an integer in the range [-231‚Ä¶ 231].
* On the second line, you will receive the entry point, which will always be between the second and the penultimate element in the array.
* On the third line, you will receive the type of items John wants to break, which will be one of the following:
  * "cheap" ‚Äì items that have a lower price rating than the entry point item
  * "expensive" ‚Äì items that have the same price rating, or higher price rating than the entry point item
#### Output
* A single line containing the sum of price ratings and their position based on the entry point in the following format:
  * "{position} - {sum of price ratings}"
  * Positions can be "Right" or "Left"

You are given numbers in a sequence on a single line, separated by a space. After that, you will receive commands that modify the sequence differently:

* **"Add {value}"** - you should add the given value tthe end of the sequence.
* **"Remove {value}"** - you should remove the first occurrence of the given value if there is such.
* **"Replace {value} {replacement}"** - you should replace the first occurrence of the given value with the replacement if there is such occurrence.
* **"Collapse {value}"** you must remove each number with a value less than the given one.

When you receive the command "Finish", you should print the modified sequence and end the program.

Input:
* On the first line, you will receive a sequence with numbers, separated by spaces - integers in the range [-1000‚Ä¶1000].
* On the following lines, you will receive commands until the "Finish" command is received.
* The commands will always be valid.

_George is starting his own course, a Cooking Masterclass. So, he asked you tbuy the needed items._</br>
The number of items depends on how many students will sign up for the course. The educational set for one student consists of 1 package of flour, 10 eggs, and an apron.</br> 
You will be given George's budget, the number of students signed, and each item's price. You should help George calculate if the budget is enough tbuy all the items or how much more money he needs.</br> 
You should know that the aprons get dirty often, sGeorge should buy 20% more, rounded up tthe next integer. Also, every fifth package of flour is free. </br>

* Input / Constraints

#### The input data will consist of:

* budget - a floating-point number in the range [0.00‚Ä¶1000.00]
* students - an integer in the range [0‚Ä¶100]
* price for a package of flour - a floating-point number in the range [0.00‚Ä¶100.00]
* price for a single egg - a floating-point number in the range [0.00‚Ä¶100.00]
* price for a single apron - a floating-point number in the range [0.00‚Ä¶100.00]
The input data will always be valid. There is nneed tcheck it explicitly.
#### Output
The output should be printed on the console.
* If the calculated price of the items is less or equal tthe budget:
  * "Items purchased for {the cost of the items}$."
* If the calculated price is more than the budget:
  * "{neededMoney}$ more needed."
* All prices must be formatted ttwdigits after the decimal point.

<details><summary>üõ†Ô∏èExample</summary>

_The National Revenue Agency hired you tcreate software, which will help them tcalculate the vehicle taxes.</br>_
You will be given a string representing vehicles that will be taxed. Each vehicle is separated by ">>", where the first element is a string representing the car type, the second element is an integer representing the years the tax should be paid, and the third element is an integer representing the kilometers traveled.</br>
There are three valid types of vehicles:</br>
* "**family**" ‚Äì the initial tax for a family car is 50 euros</br>
* " **heavyDuty**" ‚Äì the initial tax for a heavy-duty is 80 euros</br>
* "**sports**" ‚Äì the initial tax for a sports car is 100 euros</br>
If the car is not valid print **"Invalid car type."** and continue tthe next vehicle.</br>
When calculating tax keep in mind the following rules:</br> 
* For a **family** car, the tax declines by 5 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increases by **12 euros** for every **3000 km**. traveled. 
* For a **heavyDuty** car, the tax declines by 8 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increases by **14 euros** for every **9000 km**. traveled.
* For a **sports** car, the tax declines by 9 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increase by **18 euros** for every **2000 km**. Traveled.</br>

#### Input</br>
You receive a string representing the vehicles, separated with ">>": **"vehicle1>>vehicle2>>vehicle3‚Ä¶"**.
#### Output</br>
* Upon every successful taxed car print: "**A {car type} car will pay {total tax tpay} euros in taxes.**" Format the total tax tpay tthe second digit after the decimal point.
* On the last line, print how much the National Revenue Agency will collect: **"The National Revenue Agency will collect {total tax collected} euros in taxes."** Formatted tthe second digit after the decimal point.

First, you will receive the days of the adventure, the count of the players, and the group's energy. Afterward, you will receive provisions for a day for one person:

* Water
* Food
* 
The group calculates how many supplies they'd need for the adventure and takes that much water and food.
Every day they chop wood and lose a certain amount of energy. For each of the days, you are going to receive the amount of energy lost from chopping wood. The program should end if the energy reaches 0 or less.</br>
Every second day they drink water, which boosts their energy with 5% of their current energy and at the same time drops their water supplies by 30% of their current water.</br>
Every third day they eat, which reduces their food supplies (all food they have) by the following amount:</br>
**{currentFood} / {countOfPeople}** and at the same time raises their group's energy by 10%.</br>
The chopping of wood, the drinking of water, and the eating happen in the order above.</br>
If they have enough energy to finish the quest, print the following message:</br>
**"You are ready for the quest. You will be left with - {energyLevel} energy!"**</br>
If they run out of energy, print the following message and the food and water they were left with before they ran out of energy:</br>
**"You will run out of energy. You will be left with {food} food and {water} water."**</br>

### Input / Constraints

* On the 1st line, you will receive a number N - the days of the adventure ‚Äì an integer in the range [1‚Ä¶100].
* On the 2nd line ‚Äì the number of players ‚Äì an integer in the range [1 ‚Äì 1000].
* On the 3rd line - the group's energy ‚Äì a real number in the range [1 - 50000].
* On the 4th line ‚Äì water per day for one person ‚Äì a real number [0.00 ‚Äì 1000.00].
* On the 5th line ‚Äì food per day for one person ‚Äì a real number [0.00 ‚Äì 1000.00].
* On the next N lines ‚Äì one for each of the days ‚Äì the amount of energy loss‚Äì a real number in the range [0.00 - 1000.00].
* You will always have enough food and water.

### Output
* The final numbers should be formatted to the second digit after the decimal separator.
