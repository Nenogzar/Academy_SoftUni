<details> <summary>üõ†Ô∏èüêç Example & Code</summary>

####

<details><summary>üõ†Ô∏èExample</summary>

Create a program that will help Anna calculate how many biscuits her factory can make in a month (**30 days**) and the percentage of production compared tanother factory's production.</br>
First, you will receive the biscuits produced **per day** (per worker). After that, you will receive the count of workers in your factory. Last, you will receive the number of biscuits that the **competing factory produces for 30 days**.</br>
You need tcalculate the production of your factory within **30 days**. Then you should calculate how much more or less biscuits you produce compared tthe other factory (**in percentage**). There will be ncase where the factories will produce the same number of biscuits.</br>
Every **third day** the workers produce **only 75%** of the usual production. Keep in mind that there can be only a whole biscuit after making calculations for each day ‚Äì format them tthe lower number.</br>
In the end, **print the number** of biscuits produced for **30 days** in the following format:</br>
**"You have produced {countBiscuits} biscuits for the past month.**"</br>
Then print the **percentage of the difference**, formatted tthe 2nd decimal place, in the following format:</br>
If your production is **bigger** than the other factory:</br>
**"You produce {percentage} percent more biscuits."**</br>
If not:</br>
**"You produce {percentage} percent less biscuits."**

#### Input

* On the first line, you will receive the number of biscuits a worker produces per day ‚Äì an integer number in the range [1‚Ä¶200].
* On the second line, you will receive the count of the workers in your factory ‚Äì an integer number in the range [1‚Ä¶1000].
* On the third line, you will receive the number of biscuits that the competing factory produces for 30 days ‚Äì an integer number in the range [1‚Ä¶264].
NOTE: The input will always be in the correct format.

#### Output

* Print the number of biscuits produced for 30 days in the format described above.
* Print the percentage of the difference formatted tthe 2nd decimal place in the format described above.

#### Constraints
* The percentage can be over 100%.
* There will be ncase where the factories will produce the same number of biscuits.

> 2. Coffee Lover | [judge]()  | [problem]() |

<details> <summary>üõ†Ô∏èüêç Example & Code</summary>

_John is a lover of expensive and luxurious coffees._

Create a program that helps John keep track of the coffee he has. You will receive a list of the coffees that John has in stock, on a single line separated by a single space in the following format:</br>
**"{coffee1} {coffee2} {coffee3} ... {coffeeNn}"**.
Then you will receive a number ‚Äì n - a count of commands you need to execute over your list. There are four possible commands:

* **"Include {coffee}"**:
  * Add the coffee at the end of your list.
* **"Remove {first/last} {numberOfCoffees}"**:
  * Depending on the input, remove either the "**first**" or the "**last**" number of coffees from your list.
  * If you have fewer coffees in your list than the given number, skip this command.
* **"Prefer {coffeeIndex1} {coffeeIndex2}"**:
  * If both coffee indexes exist in your list, take the two coffees and change their places.
  * Otherwise, skip the command.
* **"Reverse"**:
  * Reverse the order of the coffees.

In the end, print the manipulated list in the following format:
"Coffees:
{coffee1} {coffee2} ‚Ä¶ {coffeeNn}"


#### Input / Constraints

* On the 1st line, you will receive the **starting** list with the names of the coffees separated by a " " (empty space).
* On the 2nd line, you will receive the **number** of commands - n ‚Äì an integer in the range [1‚Ä¶100].
* On the following n lines, you will be receiving **commands** in the format described above.
#### Output
* Print the list after the manipulations in the format described above.

<details><summary>üõ†Ô∏èExample</summary>

_John is very angry with his owner because he left him alone during the teamwork defenses for the Programming Fundamentals Course at SoftUni. It's time for John to get his payback, and he will do it by breaking various household items._

Each item has a **price rating**, a number that describes how valuable that item is for John's owner. You will be **given an entry point** from which John will **break** the **items to his left** and **then** to **his right**. John **will never** break the item at his **entry point**.</br>
You must calculate the damage to **both** his **left** and **right**, then print **only the higher (bigger)** damage to the household. If both **sums** are **equal**, print the **left** one.</br>
#### Input / Constrains
* On the first line, you will receive the price ratings, separated by (", "). Each element will be an integer in the range [-231‚Ä¶ 231].
* On the second line, you will receive the entry point, which will always be between the second and the penultimate element in the array.
* On the third line, you will receive the type of items John wants to break, which will be one of the following:
  * "cheap" ‚Äì items that have a lower price rating than the entry point item
  * "expensive" ‚Äì items that have the same price rating, or higher price rating than the entry point item
#### Output
* A single line containing the sum of price ratings and their position based on the entry point in the following format:
  * "{position} - {sum of price ratings}"
  * Positions can be "Right" or "Left"

You are given numbers in a sequence on a single line, separated by a space. After that, you will receive commands that modify the sequence differently:

* **"Add {value}"** - you should add the given value tthe end of the sequence.
* **"Remove {value}"** - you should remove the first occurrence of the given value if there is such.
* **"Replace {value} {replacement}"** - you should replace the first occurrence of the given value with the replacement if there is such occurrence.
* **"Collapse {value}"** you must remove each number with a value less than the given one.

When you receive the command "Finish", you should print the modified sequence and end the program.

Input:
* On the first line, you will receive a sequence with numbers, separated by spaces - integers in the range [-1000‚Ä¶1000].
* On the following lines, you will receive commands until the "Finish" command is received.
* The commands will always be valid.

Output
* Print a single line the array of numbers separated by a space, with the modified values.

_George is starting his own course, a Cooking Masterclass. So, he asked you tbuy the needed items._</br>
The number of items depends on how many students will sign up for the course. The educational set for one student consists of 1 package of flour, 10 eggs, and an apron.</br> 
You will be given George's budget, the number of students signed, and each item's price. You should help George calculate if the budget is enough tbuy all the items or how much more money he needs.</br> 
You should know that the aprons get dirty often, sGeorge should buy 20% more, rounded up tthe next integer. Also, every fifth package of flour is free. </br>

* Input / Constraints

#### The input data will consist of:

* budget - a floating-point number in the range [0.00‚Ä¶1000.00]
* students - an integer in the range [0‚Ä¶100]
* price for a package of flour - a floating-point number in the range [0.00‚Ä¶100.00]
* price for a single egg - a floating-point number in the range [0.00‚Ä¶100.00]
* price for a single apron - a floating-point number in the range [0.00‚Ä¶100.00]
The input data will always be valid. There is nneed tcheck it explicitly.
#### Output
The output should be printed on the console.
* If the calculated price of the items is less or equal tthe budget:
  * "Items purchased for {the cost of the items}$."
* If the calculated price is more than the budget:
  * "{neededMoney}$ more needed."
* All prices must be formatted ttwdigits after the decimal point.

_The National Revenue Agency hired you tcreate software, which will help them tcalculate the vehicle taxes.</br>_
You will be given a string representing vehicles that will be taxed. Each vehicle is separated by ">>", where the first element is a string representing the car type, the second element is an integer representing the years the tax should be paid, and the third element is an integer representing the kilometers traveled.</br>
There are three valid types of vehicles:</br>
* "**family**" ‚Äì the initial tax for a family car is 50 euros</br>
* " **heavyDuty**" ‚Äì the initial tax for a heavy-duty is 80 euros</br>
* "**sports**" ‚Äì the initial tax for a sports car is 100 euros</br>
If the car is not valid print **"Invalid car type."** and continue tthe next vehicle.</br>
When calculating tax keep in mind the following rules:</br> 
* For a **family** car, the tax declines by 5 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increases by **12 euros** for every **3000 km**. traveled. 
* For a **heavyDuty** car, the tax declines by 8 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increases by **14 euros** for every **9000 km**. traveled.
* For a **sports** car, the tax declines by 9 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increase by **18 euros** for every **2000 km**. Traveled.</br>

#### Input</br>
You receive a string representing the vehicles, separated with ">>": **"vehicle1>>vehicle2>>vehicle3‚Ä¶"**.

> 01. The Hunting Games  | [judge]()  | [problem]() |


<details> <summary>üõ†Ô∏èüêç Example & Code</summary>

####

_A group of friends has decided to participate in a game. The first stage of the game is to gather some supplies. They have a list, and your job is to help them follow it and make the needed calculations._

Write a program that calculates the needed provisions for a quest in the woods.</br>
First, you will receive the days of the adventure, the count of the players, and the group's energy. Afterward, you will receive provisions for a day for one person:

* Water
* Food
* 
The group calculates how many supplies they'd need for the adventure and takes that much water and food.
Every day they chop wood and lose a certain amount of energy. For each of the days, you are going to receive the amount of energy lost from chopping wood. The program should end if the energy reaches 0 or less.</br>
Every second day they drink water, which boosts their energy with 5% of their current energy and at the same time drops their water supplies by 30% of their current water.</br>
Every third day they eat, which reduces their food supplies (all food they have) by the following amount:</br>
**{currentFood} / {countOfPeople}** and at the same time raises their group's energy by 10%.</br>
The chopping of wood, the drinking of water, and the eating happen in the order above.</br>
If they have enough energy to finish the quest, print the following message:</br>
**"You are ready for the quest. You will be left with - {energyLevel} energy!"**</br>
If they run out of energy, print the following message and the food and water they were left with before they ran out of energy:</br>
**"You will run out of energy. You will be left with {food} food and {water} water."**</br>

### Input / Constraints

* On the 1st line, you will receive a number N - the days of the adventure ‚Äì an integer in the range [1‚Ä¶100].
* On the 2nd line ‚Äì the number of players ‚Äì an integer in the range [1 ‚Äì 1000].
* On the 3rd line - the group's energy ‚Äì a real number in the range [1 - 50000].
* On the 4th line ‚Äì water per day for one person ‚Äì a real number [0.00 ‚Äì 1000.00].
* On the 5th line ‚Äì food per day for one person ‚Äì a real number [0.00 ‚Äì 1000.00].
* On the next N lines ‚Äì one for each of the days ‚Äì the amount of energy loss‚Äì a real number in the range [0.00 - 1000.00].
* You will always have enough food and water.

### Output
* The final numbers should be formatted to the second digit after the decimal separator.
